Welcome to my portfolio!

I created it using Mobile first approach and it is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. 


# Accessibility Testing

- Devices: What was accessible to me (iPhone 8 plus, iPad Safari, Macbook Air and Android ).

- Cross browser testing in Fireforx, Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge 

- HTML Validation: Used Lighthouse in Chrome Dev tools (Scored -  96 Performance, 100 Accessibility, 100 Best Pratices and 100 SEO).
I also used W3C (validator.w3.org) for validation.

- Screen Reader testing done with ChromeVox classic extension

- Color contrast checked with Chrome Dev Tools elements inspector.
